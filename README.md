# servingHtmlPages
This app will run on Node JS

No other dependency has been used in this project. Everything, from creating server to responding to client requests is done using core
NodeJS modules ('fs' module which comes up with the default setup of Node server)

A very basic approach has been used in this project to serve HTML pages in browser.

Images/Stylesheets've been loaded from other folders as a lot of questions have been seen on net on how to load images/styles from differnt folder
